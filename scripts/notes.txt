This is the 'scripts' subfolder. This will contain pure Python files (not Django) which can be called by Django but which will not have Django code within them.

Primarily this subfolder will contain the implementation of the kernel of the Blackout game i.e. a class that will implement the game at a very basic level. The Django code will interface with the class using its API and will then implement the web-end of it, but the class itself will be designed to work in an abstract fashion and allow a game to be played via the terminal, albeit with all players taking there turns on the terminal itself.

A separate terminal interface will be written to help debug the kernel but an effort will be made to keep the kernel separate from the terminal-specific interface.
